# launch.ne

A scalable, upgrade-friendly Next.js boilerplate with type-safe envs, shadcn/ui, Biome, performance optimizations, and a scalable dara folder pattern and more.

This project exists to reduce the time spent configuring tools and let you start building real features immediately.

## ✨ Goals
- Zero-friction setup  
  - Start a new project without spending hours configuring linting, styling, envs, and structure.
- Type safety everywhere  
  - From environment variables to utilities and hooks.
- Scalable by default  
  - Designed to grow with your application, not fight against it.
- Upgrade-friendly  
  - Avoid brittle setups that break on Next.js upgrades.
- Opinionated, but flexible  
  - Strong defaults that can still be customized or replaced.
